Hello! My name is Abhi Jadhav, and I am a recent graduate from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). I studied biomedical engineering and computer science where I explored the intersection of health and machine learning. Currently, I am a software engineer at [Roblox Corporation](https://www.roblox.com/). Recently, I have been enamored by the world of software/computer performance, which I enjoy writing about as I learn/explore.
